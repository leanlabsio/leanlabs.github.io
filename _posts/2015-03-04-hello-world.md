A few days ago we released our first open source project - Leanlabs Kanban board for GitLab issues!

This release includes:

- Full featured GitLab issues integration. Leanlabs Kanban cards are GitLab issues, you can select milestones, assign card, manage labels

- Checklist in cards

- GitLab Flavoured markdown support (partially)

- Real-time task boards synchronised through WebSocket

- Authorization with GitLab OAuth (by private token for older GitLab versions)

- ACL (based on your GitLab permissions)

- Drag and drop cards

- Project based workflow customisation (including sensitive defaults)

- Mobile friendly

- Easy deployment on your servers

We have done a lot. But even more we plan to implement in the near future, so stay tuned!
